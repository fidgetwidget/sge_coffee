# Small Galaxy Engine (Coffeescript edition): sge_coffee 0.1

Just my tinkering around in html5 gamedev 

My priority is on the things I need for the demos and prototypes I make, but I am
interested in feedback and welcome participation to make this better for anyone 
wanting to use it.

The files for the game are in assets/js 

## Technologies

* pixijs https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js
* statsjs https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js

The Webserver I am using is:
* Express Coffee Template 8 (1.8.1)  https://github.com/twilson63/express-coffee
** Lots of things that this is built on... see it's docs for details.

NOTE: the actual game stuff doesn't need to be run on Node... at this time.
